## üîç How It Works

1. **User Inputs a Headline**  
   Example: _"Behind the Pahalgam attack is Pakistan"_

2. **Google Search Is Triggered**  
   The app searches the headline using the `googlesearch` Python module.

3. **Trusted Source Verification**  
   It checks if results appear on pre-approved trusted sources like **BBC**, **Reuters**, **CNN**, **NDTV**, etc.

4. **AI-based News Summarization**  
   If a trusted article is found, the app summarizes it using a HuggingFace transformer model.

5. **Prediction with Confidence Score**  
   Based on presence in trusted sources, it predicts whether the news is **REAL** or **FAKE**, with a confidence percentage.

6. **Visualization**  
   A simple graph shows the confidence level visually.
